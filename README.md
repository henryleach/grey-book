# Hugo Grey Book Theme

A simple, blog focused, theme for the sophisticated reader and blogger with ideas above their station. 

- [Example Site](https://grey-book-theme-example.onrender.com)

Features:

- Archive
- Tags
- Emacs Org Mode friendly
- Featured Images in post summary
- Light & Dark modes
- A long, warm, rich aftertaste with hints of an autumn bonfire, like a good whisky

The Light/Dark themes are automatic and will be selected on the basis of the user's system and browser settings, there is no manual selection option. All images will be converted to WebP (except for org-mode posts, see changelog).

## Installation

### As Git Submodule

1. Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

```bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/henryleach/grey-book.git themes/grey-book
```

2. Add the theme's directory to your `hugo.toml`:

```
theme = "grey-book"
```

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

### As a Simple Download

Download the theme as a [zip file](https://github.com/henryleach/grey-book/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from Github, then unzip it into a folder `themes/grey-book`.

## Getting started

After installing the theme, you need to update the `config.toml` file in your site's root directory. 

### Configuration

Inside the [`exampleSite`](https://github.com/henryleach/grey-book/tree/main/exampleSite) folder of this theme is a [`config.toml`](https://github.com/henryleach/grey-book/blob/master/exampleSite/hugo.toml) example config file. Copy it to the root directory of your site and change the options as you please.

> âš  You will probably need to delete the line: `themesDir = "../../"` which is needed to make the example theme site work.

### Logo and Favicon

Set them to whichever image you like using the parameters below. This path is relative to your assets directory, e.g. `assets` unless you've modified that value. Avatar size is 150x150px.

```
[params]
favicon = "images/yourfavicon.jpg"
avatar = "images/youravatar.jpg"
roundAvatar = false
```

### Featured Image

Any post can have a featured image set that will be used on the default list page along with the post's summary. Simply add `featured_image = "filename.jpg"` to your post's front matter.

If you are using pageBundles and you don't specify an image, one from the pageBundle will be automatically added. If you specifically _don't_ want to have a featured image, then set featured_image to a none existent filename, e.g.: `featured_image = "none"`.


### Archetypes

Grey Book has two pageBundle archetypes, depending if you want to create a Markdown or Org Mode based post. Either:

```sh
$ hugo new --kind md-post /posts/my-new-post-name
```
or for a Org Mode based post:

```sh
$ hugo new --kind org-post /posts/my-new-post-name
```

### Individual Post Styling Options

It's possible to extend/replace the styling for an individual post. The extend the style add the following to the post's front matter (in TOML format), where 'style.css' is an additional stylesheet added in the post's page bundle folder:
```toml
[params]
  stylesheets = ['/css/style.css', 'style.css']
```

If you wish the extend the existing style, include `/css/style.css` as the **first** style sheet in the list.

This will keep all the HTML structure of the page, but allow extending/replacing the styling. Making the existing document structure work, and safe from future style changes, can be hard. It's also possible to add `layout = 'barehtml'` into the front matter, which means everything on your post is just dropped into the `body` elements of a page, and only keeps the page header metadata. If you do this it's recommended to write the post in HTMl format, so you can add the additional structure the page probably needs.

See the two relevant posts in the ExampleSite folder to see how this can be implemented in more detail.


## Analytics

There are templates to add analytics scripts for [TinyAnalytics](https://tinyanalytics.io).

To avoid these being triggered in testing, they are only rendered if either you have an environment variable called 'HUGO_ENV' set to "production" or in the config file you have the 'env' variable set.

```
[params]
env = "production"
```

### TinyAnalytics

Set the following in the config file, if omitted or set to `false` it is not rendered. The site-id can be found when looking at the tracking code and is the jumble of letters after the last slash: `https://app.tinyanalytics.io/pixel/<this-bit-here>`.

```
[params]
tinyAnalytics = "your tiny-analyics-tracking-code"
```

## Fediverse/OpenGraph Integration

This template includes meta details for richer integration into Fediverse applications like Mastodon and generate [preview cards](https://box464.com/posts/mastodon-preview-cards).

To check your site's metadata you can use [Robb Knight's Lens tool](https://lens.rknight.me).

### Me Links

You can verify your Mastodon profile by adding one or more (you may have multiple profiles) me links in a list:

```toml
meLinks = ["https://example.com/@user"]
```

### Fediverse Creator

Compatible with Mastodon v4.3+. Make sure to add your domain under *Settings >
 Profile > Verification - Author attribution*. Then add the line below to your site's `hugo.toml` file.
 
```toml
fediverseCreator = "@user@example.com"
```
### Preview Image

If your page has a featured image, this will be used to create a OpenGraph image that is used to generate. If there is no image, or it's the homepage, it will fall back to what is defined under `openGraphImage`. It's best to include this, otherwise some services will keep trying to generate one

```toml
openGraphImage = "images/og_image.png"
```
