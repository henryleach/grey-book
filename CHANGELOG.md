# 2021.08.12

- Changed font to Serif
- Adjust font size, also in Navigation
- Added previous/next links to bottom of single (post) pages
- Added LinkedIn logo for social media links
- Made Favicon to parameter
- Made Avatar to parameter
- Made Avatar div square
- Removed the hidden chain links symbol that appeared next to headings and provided you with the anchor. This was rendered in the summaries if there was a heading within the summary text, and looked weird. Now the heading text is the anchor point directly.
